## Detailed Usage Guide

### 1. Navigating the Dashboard

The Prism dashboard is the central hub for all your data analysis activities. Here's how to navigate it:

1. Open the application in your browser and click on "Dashboard" in the navigation bar.
2. The dashboard displays several key components:
   - **Data Import**: Tools for bringing data into the system
   - **Visualizations**: Interactive charts and graphs
   - **AI Analysis**: AI-powered insights from your data
   - **Data Management**: Manage your datasets

### 2. Importing Data

Prism supports multiple data sources to get your data into the system:

#### CSV Import

1. On the dashboard, locate the "Import Data" section and click on "CSV Upload"
2. Click the file upload area or drag and drop your CSV file
3. The system will parse your CSV and display a preview of the data
4. Verify the data types and headers are correct
5. Click "Import" to complete the process

#### API Connection

1. On the dashboard, go to the "Import Data" section and select "API Connection"
2. Enter the API endpoint URL
3. If the API requires authentication, click "Add Authentication" and enter your credentials
4. Choose the authentication type (Basic, Bearer Token, API Key)
5. Click "Test Connection" to verify access
6. Once connected, click "Import Data" to fetch and parse the data

### 3. Creating Visualizations

After importing your data, you can create various visualizations:

1. Navigate to the "Visualizations" section of the dashboard
2. Click "Create New Chart"
3. Select a chart type (Line, Bar, Area, Pie, or Scatter)
4. Configure your chart:
   - Select the data source from your imported datasets
   - Choose X and Y axes
   - Add data series (for multi-series charts)
   - Configure grouping and aggregation (sum, average, count)
   - Set colors and styling options
5. Click "Generate Chart" to create the visualization
6. Use the interactive features to explore your data:
   - Hover for tooltips
   - Zoom in/out (for time series)
   - Filter data points

### 4. AI Analysis

Prism's AI-powered analysis helps you discover insights in your data:

1. Navigate to the "AI Analysis" section
2. Select the dataset you want to analyze
3. Configure analysis options:
   - Focus: Choose what to focus on (trends, anomalies, correlations, or all)
   - Field Selection: Identify time, value, and category fields
4. Click "Run AI Analysis"
5. Review the results in the following tabs:
   - **Insights**: Key actionable insights from your data
   - **Trends**: Identified patterns and trends
   - **Anomalies**: Unusual data points or outliers
   - **Correlations**: Relationships between different variables
6. Click "Create Visualization" to automatically generate relevant charts based on the analysis

### 5. Working with Large Datasets

Prism is optimized for handling large datasets efficiently:

1. When importing large files (>10MB), the system will automatically:

   - Sample the data for preview
   - Apply efficient parsing strategies
   - Use streaming where possible

2. For visualization of large datasets:

   - Use the "Data Sampling" option to control how many data points to display
   - Apply filters to focus on specific segments of your data
   - Use date range selectors for time series data

3. For AI analysis of large datasets:
   - The system automatically samples the data to stay within API limits
   - You can adjust the sampling method in the advanced options
   - Consider using more specific "Focus" options to get more targeted results

### 6. Saving and Sharing

To save your work and share insights:

1. After creating visualizations or running analyses, click the "Save" button
2. Enter a name and optional description
3. Choose where to save:
   - "My Dashboard" for personal use
   - "Shared Dashboards" to make it available to others
4. To share specific insights:
   - Click the "Share" button on any visualization or analysis
   - Select "Copy Link" to get a direct URL
   - Or choose "Export" to download as PNG, PDF, or CSV

### 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Data Import Problems**

   - Ensure CSV files use standard formatting and UTF-8 encoding
   - For API connections, verify your authentication credentials and endpoint URLs

2. **Visualization Issues**

   - Check that your data has appropriate types (numbers for numerical axes, etc.)
   - For time series, ensure dates are in a recognized format (YYYY-MM-DD recommended)

3. **AI Analysis Errors**

   - Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient quota
   - For timeout errors, try reducing the dataset size or focusing the analysis

4. **Performance Issues**
   - For very large datasets, consider applying filters before visualization
   - Use the browser's refresh button if the dashboard becomes unresponsive

## AI Integration

Prism includes OpenAI integration to provide intelligent analysis of your data and suggest optimal visualizations:

### AI-Powered Visualization Suggestions

The dashboard uses OpenAI to analyze your dataset and suggest the most effective visualizations based on:

1. **Data characteristics**: Identifies numeric, categorical, and temporal data
2. **Statistical properties**: Analyzes distributions, outliers, and relationships
3. **Best practices**: Applies data visualization best practices to suggest chart types

### How It Works

1. After uploading your data, navigate to the "AI Analysis" tab
2. Click on "AI Visualization Suggestions"
3. Click "Generate Visualization Suggestions"
4. Review the AI-recommended visualizations
5. Click "Apply This Visualization" on any suggestion you want to use

This feature helps you quickly identify meaningful patterns and insights in your data without manually configuring each chart.

### Environment Setup

To use the AI features, you need to set up an OpenAI API key in your `.env.local` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
